                    <h3 class="animated slow fadeInUp">Are ghosts real?</h3>
                    <p class="animated slow fadeInUp">The existence of the paranormal has always been a question on people’s minds. We have all tried to persuade ourselves that the noises in the night are not real, but after capture the evidence for ourselves, we have no choice but the believe that there is some sort of supernatural presence around us. </p>
                    <h3 class="animated delay-1s slow fadeInUp">What even is a ghost?</h3>
                    <p class="animated delay-1s slow fadeInUp">There's many different definitions, but one thing we have to remember is to not mix Hollywood's fictional view of ghosts with the logical. We believe a ghost is the energy and spirit (or soul) of a person who has passed away and is either stuck between the veils of existence, unable to cross over, or have chosen to stay on our level of existence by choice. The reasons why (or how) ghosts are here truly remains a mystery. The best we can do is make educated guesses and well-formed opinions based on years of researched information and documented evidence.</p>
                    <h3 class="animated delay-2s slow fadeInUp">My house is haunted, what do I do?</h3>
                    <p class="animated delay-2s slow fadeInUp">The first step is to really analyze the situation yourself. Think about all the things that you feel are happening and try to determine if any could possibly be caused by nature or human interaction. If there's anything that you can rule as a natural occurrence then you should rule that phenomena out. What you want to look for are the things that are truly unexplainable. There are sure signs of a haunting, such as objects being moved, voices, clouds or mist, physical interaction and apparitions. If you truly feel your home is experiencing paranormal phenomena, then evaluate that phenomena. You need to decide if it's something you can live with. If so, and if the haunting seems to be harmless, then you should probably do nothing. Just live with the experiences and accept them. If you're experiencing something frightening or possibly something evil, or if it's a situation that you simply can't live with, then you need to contact a paranormal investigation group or investigator, like us.</p>
                    <h3 class="animated delay-3s slow fadeInUp">What is a certified ghost hunter?</h3>
                    <p class="animated delay-3s slow fadeInUp">The title of a “certified ghost hunter” is fictional. While there are investigators, like our team, that have received specialized training from paranormal courses that teach the proper use of our equipment and evidence evaluation, there are many fake investigators out there that will state that they are “certified.” There are no actual accredited paranormal courses, which means that there is no real certification that investigators can recieve.
                        <br /> As well, the term “ghost hunter” is often used by novices entering the field. Professionals will always use the terms “paranormal investigator” or “Paranormal Researcher”. Although we use these titles, this does not mean any group who claims they are certified are not professional, they very well could be. Different groups have different ways of conducting their investigations.
